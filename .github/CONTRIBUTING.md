# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks to contribute to Green Complaint! Here is the guidelines to help to the project. Please read this **_before_ doing anything.**

## Pull requests

If you have a new feature of a patch for an error. We recommend **_first_** create an issue or a discussion to talk abuot the feature of error. This because we don't want to decline some of it. If the people accepts. Then you can work on that.

## Tests

To test any new feature that are you working, or checking if an error has been fixed, check this to get ready the server.

First, open 2 consoles, one for the server, and other for the styles (later I'll be working for a CLI to have only one console). In one console, run the next command:
    
    npm run dev

In the other, run this for the styles:

    npm run build-css

Now, check [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) for the app.
