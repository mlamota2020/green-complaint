### Scripts

There are some scripts for development and production.

#### 1.- `npm start`

With `npm start`, Green Complaint will start the server at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

#### 2.- `npm run dev` and `npm run dev-css`

`npm run dev` starts a development server powered by Nodemon by restarting it for you when you do changes. To work correctly, you need to run in another console `npm run dev-css` to create the styles on demand.

#### 3.- `npm run build-css`

Use this command to create the actual styles on the app. The diference with `npm run dev-css` is that the command is always watching, and `build-css` isn't watching. 

## FAQs

1. ### What if I want to contribute the repo?

Well, you can make changes and create a pull request with the commit. DON'T MAKE THE CHANGES DIRECTLY!!

2. ### I'm a 32 bits Windows user and the app doesn't work

The app is only for the 64 bits Windows version. Sorry for the inconveniences.

3. ### I'm building the app for all platforms and it throw me an error saying that it can't wrote an app for 'x' platform. What do I do?

Check that you're builing with admin privileges. This will help to create the app for other plaforms.
